# About

## Abstract
This repository contains python programs of artificial intelligence based tic-tac-toe on 3x3 grid. The game is divided into single player and two players, and it's difficulty varies from easy to hard. In hard category of single player it is impossible to defeat the computer. This game is implemented using mini-max algorithm.

## Detailed

This repository contains 4 python files. The easy python file is implemented using normal algorithm which based on general strategy of playing game. The medium and hard is implemented using mini-max algorithm of artificial algorithm. In medium the first turn is player's turn and in the hard game the first turn is computer's turn. 

Upon running any program, the game will be displayed in output console, the moves can be done by keyboard input as mentioned in the output console (i.e., 1 for cell [0,0]). This game is very easy and fun to play. The minimax algorithm here finds the best place to put its pot (X or O). The goal of the algorithm is to defeat the player. 

Here is the screenshot of ouput console when starting the game.

# Prerequisits
`Python==3.6`

# Getting started
1. Download the zip file and unzip it.
2. Run python files to play the game in single player or two players mode.
3. When you win or lose or draw the game will be stopped and message will be shown.
4. Read `instructions.txt` for better understanding of repository.

# Future work 
In future i'm looking forward to implement this game for 4x4 and 5x5 grid.
