This repository contains 4 python programms.
The single player files are divided into three categories by their difficulty levels. 
The easy file is implemented using normal algorithm based on simple strategy to play the game(i.e., to counter the opponent).
The medium file is implemented using minimax algorithm and in this game the first turn will be player's turn and in this game it is difficult to defeat
the computer. 
The hard file is also implemented using minimax algorithm and in this game the first turn will be computer's turn and in this game it is impossible to defeat 
the computer.

All lines in all files are self explainatory. Run any file to play according the game.
